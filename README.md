# hello-world

Hi my name is John Nazarene!

I'm here to learn about coding and stuffs related to it. I've bought a course on Udemy about Web Development
and Java to better gain knowledge and be proficient to it. I do hope years from now I'll be better and someday I'll find this
hello-world repository which I read from the guide here in GitHub :D
